# Dependency Upgrade Notes

This file tracks dependencies that were not upgraded during the systematic upgrade process and the reasons why.

## Date: 2025-12-02

### Skipped Upgrades

#### Spring Boot 3.1.2 → 3.3.0
**Status:** Skipped - Test failures

**Attempted:** 2025-12-02

**Issue:**
- Compilation successful
- Simple unit tests pass (e.g., JobCodeBreakoutTest)
- Integration tests fail with Spring context initialization errors
- Error: `ApplicationContext failure threshold (1) exceeded: skipping repeated attempt to load context`
- Tests using `@SpringBootTest` and Testcontainers fail to initialize
- Root cause appears to be Spring context loading failure in test environment

**Affected Tests:**
- All tests extending `SpringTest` or using `BaseDockerizedTest`
- Tests that require Testcontainers (MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch)

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate Spring Boot 3.3.0 compatibility with Testcontainers 1.21.3
- May need to upgrade Testcontainers version
- Review Spring Boot 3.3.0 migration guide for breaking changes
- Consider testing with Spring Boot 3.2.x as intermediate step
- Revisit after other dependency upgrades are complete

**Additional Notes:**
- Deprecation warnings observed: `exceptionHandling()` deprecated in Spring Security
- These are warnings, not blockers, but should be addressed
