# Single-Auth Profile Configuration
# 
# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: This profile is intended ONLY for local development and testing.
# DO NOT use this profile in production, staging, or any environment accessible from the internet.
# The single-auth profile provides simple admin username/password authentication and should never be used where security is a concern.
#
# This profile enables simple authentication with a single admin user.
# Admin credentials are provided via environment variables, with defaults in development mode.
# Authorization rules are still enforced using the same role-based logic as OAuth2 mode.

# Admin username for single-auth profile
# If not set, defaults to 'admin' in development mode
# Can be overridden via SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_USERNAME environment variable
#app.single-auth.admin-username=admin

# Admin password for single-auth profile
# If not set, defaults to 'admin' in development mode
# Can be overridden via SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable
#app.single-auth.admin-password=admin

# Enable role-based authorization (can be overridden)
# When true: Role-based access control is enforced (Admin, Curator, View, Read roles)
# When false: Simple authentication is used (any authenticated user can access endpoints)
# Default: true
app.enableRoles=true

# Override login URL for UI (no OAuth2 redirect needed in single-auth mode)
# In single-auth mode, this is set to /login to skip OAuth2 redirect flow
# The UI will handle admin username/password authentication
app.loginUrl=/login

# Override auth mode for single-auth profile
app.authMode=single-auth
