# Single-Auth Profile Configuration
#
# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: This profile is intended ONLY for local development and testing.
# DO NOT use this profile in production, staging, or any environment accessible from the internet.
# The single-auth profile provides simple admin username/password authentication and should never
# be used where security is a concern.
#
# This profile enables authentication with a single admin user account.
# Admin credentials can be configured via:
#   - Properties: app.single-auth.admin-username and app.single-auth.admin-password
#   - Environment variables: SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_USERNAME, SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD
#   - Defaults: username='admin', password='admin' (if not configured)
#
# Authentication methods supported:
#   - HTTP Basic Authentication (username:password in Authorization header)
#   - Bearer token authentication (JWT tokens from /api/auth/login endpoint)
#
# Authorization rules are still enforced using the same role-based logic as OAuth2 mode.
# Authenticated admin users receive ROLE_Osmt_Admin and are subject to the same authorization
# rules as OAuth2-authenticated users.

# Admin username for single-auth profile
# If not set, defaults to 'admin'
# Can be overridden via environment variable: SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_USERNAME
#app.single-auth.admin-username=admin

# Admin password for single-auth profile
# If not set, defaults to 'admin'
# Can be overridden via environment variable: SINGLE_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD
#app.single-auth.admin-password=admin

# Enable role-based authorization (can be overridden)
# When true: Role-based access control is enforced (Admin, Curator, View, Read roles)
# When false: Simple authentication is used (any authenticated user can access endpoints)
# Default: true
app.enableRoles=true

# Override login URL for UI (no OAuth2 redirect needed in single-auth mode)
# In single-auth mode, this is set to /login to skip OAuth2 redirect flow
# The UI will handle admin username/password authentication
app.loginUrl=/login

# Override auth mode for single-auth profile
app.authMode=single-auth

# Enable single-auth login option (shown on login page when true)
app.singleAuthEnabled=true
